# Tools

## Web Browser

It's best to use [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome) throughout our class. As a lot of better developer tools are only available in Chrome.

We will use some helpful browser extensions like:

* [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm): to block ads
* [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa): to make JSON easy to read

## Code Editor

We can use two kinds of editor.

For offline or local use, we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

For online, we recommend [Codepen](https://codepen.io)

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) features helpful actions like:

* command palette: press `ctrl+shift+p` on Linux or `cmd+shift+p` on Mac to activate the ultimate command palette window
* split view: drag another window to the other side (horizontal or vertical) of current window

There are even some helpful packages too:

- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
