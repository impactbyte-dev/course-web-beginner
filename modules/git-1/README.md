## Git

Git is the ultimate version control system or source code management that widely used by various people in the world.

Mostly used by developers to manage their projects and collaborate with others.

### Installation

```sh
# on ubuntu
sudo apt install git tig
# on mac
brew install git tig
```

## Commands

Some basic Git commands are

`config`, `init`, `clone`, `status`, `add`, `commit`, `log`, `checkout`, `remote`, `push`, `pull`

Firstly after we installed Git in our computer, we should `config` it first with our name and email.

```sh
$ git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
$ git config --global user.email "yourname@example.com"
```

We can initialize a new repo in an existing folder.

```sh
git init
```

After initialization, let's see the repo status.

```sh
git status
```

We would like to create a new file, then add it into our repo.

```sh
$ ls
README.md
index.html

$ git add README.md index.html
```

Then commit them with a message

```sh
$ git commit -m "Create README and HTML page"
```

See the changes log as well.

```sh
$ git log
```
